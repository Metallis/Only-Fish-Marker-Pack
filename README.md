# Metal-Marker-Myriad
This Marker Pack is primarily developed by Metallis.6105 (Discord: Metallis#9388).

I develop this pack as I have time (read: please understand pack requests may not be filled quickly) and focus my efforts primarily on usage with [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/) over [GW2 TacO](http://www.gw2taco.com/) as Blish provides some nice QoL features to make the markers and trails a little less obtrusive while still being useful. I try to make packs that haven't been done before or done to my satisfaction, but eventually I hope to offer a wide variety of markers and trails for you!

I strive to make my markers and trails (especially trails) as inclusive as possible and will be doing everything in my power to use the following [all-variant-colorblind-friendly color palette](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23000000-%23E69F00-%2356B4E9-%23009E73-%23F0E442-%230072B2-%23D55E00-%23CC79A7) wherever possible! I highly encourage my other packmaker friends to adopt these where possible, the decision was made with what input I could gather from colorblind friends.

For a full list of features, hop on over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Metallis/Metal-Marker-Myriad/wiki)!

If you have an idea for a marker pack you want me (or someone) to try and tackle, please submit your ideas [HERE](https://github.com/blish-hud/Blish-HUD/discussions/categories/requested-marker-packs)!

Support: You may find and tag me directly on the [Blish HUD Discord](https://discord.gg/FYKN3qh) for now!
